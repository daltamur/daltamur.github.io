        <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So, my laptop of almost 6 years finally gave out a month ago now. I was in a pinch and couldn't really afford to wait and maybe fix it by just getting an SSD so I gave in and bought a Thinkpad. Purists have always told me Thinkpads are the best laptops for programmers, but I would have never fathomed how great they are for everyday use and are an affordable, reasonably sized choice for anyone. </p>

        <p>First, we obviously have to talk price and in terms of cost, this is the most bang-for-your-buck laptop I've ever used. I got a 10th gen i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD, and 16 GB of RAM for all just over $800. Sure, there's specs about these specs we could go into, but they allow for maximum efficiency and are top of the line specs for any laptop.</p>

        <p>Next, we have to talk about the look. I'll be first to admit that the aesthetics of a Thinkpad aren't especially sleek like a Macbook.</p>

         <p><small>Even the promotional images can't make it look <i>not</i> just like a boring black slab.</small></p>

        <p>They really are designed primarily as business machines. No sleek or colorful bodies here, it's a no frills black box. But that's the beauty of it, they don't throw things in the machine that you're not going to use. Take tha Macbook for instance, a comparable model to the Thinkpad is nearly <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-2.6ghz-6-core-processor-512gb">$2500</a> while a Thinkpad with the exact same specs is more than $1000 less. It's because of this that I really think the Thinkpad brand is for everyone. We're in an age where laptops are a necessity and something as powerful as this at less than $1000 is some serious value that I think everyone is after. And hey, you can always get a case to doll it's black exterior up.</p>
